## 💻 Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
This will typically open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173 (the port may vary). The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.📦 Building for ProductionTo create an optimized production build:npm run build
The output files will be generated in the dist folder. This folder contains the static assets ready for deployment.☁️ DeploymentThis application is designed for easy deployment to static hosting platforms like:NetlifyVercelGitHub PagesFor Netlify / Vercel, connect your Git repository and configure the build settings as follows:Build command: npm run buildPublish directory: dist📄 React + Vite (Template Information)This section contains standard information from the Vite React template.This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.Currently, two official plugins are available:@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast RefreshExpanding the ESLint configurationIf you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
